# About Me

My name is **Zou Zhiyuan**, but you can call me **Yiyi**. 

I am a senior student majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [**Beijing Normal University**](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), under the tutelage of Professor **Liu Yongping**. I plan to go to the **United States** in 2024 for further graduate studies and intend to stay and develop my career there, dedicating myself to research in top-tier fields and contributing my knowledge and skills.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the fields of **optimization processing** and **machine learning**. Specifically, I am dedicated to using mathematical knowledge to enhance the underlying logic and computational efficiency of machine learning models, particularly in matrix operations and algorithm optimization. I aspire to design a more efficient machine learning core code framework in my future research, becoming an outstanding talent proficient in both mathematics and programming across interdisciplinary fields. 

Prior to this, I have also delved into research areas such as statistics, quantitative finance, and operations research.

Please feel free to email me to discuss potential research collaborations.(**1060981504@qq.com**)
