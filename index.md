# About Me

Here is **Songning Lai (赖颂宁)**.( You can call me Sony. )

I am a junior student studying in the School of Information Science and Engineering([**Chongxin College**](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%9C%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%B4%87%E6%96%B0%E5%AD%A6%E5%A0%82/20809738?fr=aladdin)), [**Shandong University**](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in China,supervised by Prof. [**Zhi Liu**](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/zh_CN/index.htm).

## Research Interests

My research interests are Explainable AI (XAI) and Privacy-preserving AI. Specifically, my research goal is to build faithful XAI systems which are easily understood by users and are robust in various environments (e.g. XAI4LLM, XAI4NLP, XAI4MM, XAI4CV, XAI4Security and so on). I am also interested in applying the XAI to real-world scenarios (e.g. optical systems, recommender systems, and traffic forecasting etc.).

Prior to this, I have also been exposed to bioinformatics, multimodal sentiment analysis, domain generalization and other research areas.
